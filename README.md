## Features

- **Symbolic Derivatives**  
  - Handles sums, products, quotients, powers, and common functions (`sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `ln`).  
  - Shows **step-by-step derivative computation** in LaTeX format.

- **Step-by-Step Integration**  
  - Power rule, basic functions (`sin`, `cos`, `exp`).  
  - Polynomial × simple function integration (e.g., `x*sin(x)`, `x*exp(x)`).  
  - Handles sums of terms (e.g., `x*sin(x) + 1`).  
  - Linear substitution for `ax + b` arguments.  
  - Outputs integrals in **readable LaTeX format**.

- **MathJax & Math.js Integration**  
  - Renders math beautifully in the browser.  
  - Symbolic computation powered by Math.js.

- **Clean UI**  
  - Simple, responsive interface.  
  - Input field + buttons for derivative/integral computations.  
  - Step-by-step results displayed clearly.
